# Programming Entrance Task - HoskaDev

This task focuses on building a modern and professional user interface using core web technologies. The primary goals are outlined as follows:

## 1. **Using Core Technologies (Native Technologies)**:
- **HTML & CSS**: Use HTML and CSS to directly build the structure and design of the web pages, without relying on pre-built libraries.
- **AJAX**: Implement AJAX to update data dynamically without reloading the page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use the Tailwind CSS framework for flexible and efficient layout styling, with attention to the overall look and fine details.

## 2. **Animation Handling**:
- Focus on adding interactive animations using **CSS animations** and **Transitions** to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Ensure the animations are balanced and add value without affecting performance.

## 3. **Creating Navigation and Footer Components**:
- Design the **Navigation Bar** and **Footer** as independent components to ensure reusability across all pages. These should be included using a consistent method to ensure integration and flexibility.

## 4. **Responsiveness**:
- Ensure the interface is **responsive**, adapting automatically to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile devices) using techniques like **Media Queries**, **Flexbox**, and **CSS Grid**.

## 5. **Dynamic Data Fetching**:
- Fetch application settings data using **AJAX requests** or **Fetch API** to ensure that all data remains up-to-date and synchronized with changes.

### Final Goal:
The aim is to create an attractive, interactive, and responsive interface that provides a seamless and enjoyable user experience across various devices.
